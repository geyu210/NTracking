if you have used anm node manager and would now like to control all your machines simultaneously then cluster controler is for you.


cluster controler is exactley the same scripts but running accross multiple machines via ssh to do the steps.

to set up select one machine as the master which you will run the script on in this example that will be  ```s00```

first thing is first you will need to be able to log into each machine via ssh from the master machine via short config file ie ```ssh s00```

some info on that is available here https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/create-ssh-config-file-on-linux-unix/
