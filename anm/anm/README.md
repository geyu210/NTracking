this will install the anms.sh script in /usr/bin and set the script to run on a 1 min cron schedule
on first starting nodes it will ask for

Discord username.
Logging.
Port range default is set at 55 which means first node will start on port 55001 and iterate up from there.
NodeCap this is so people from home can set a hard limit of nodes so as to not overload there routers.
